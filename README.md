# NanoGPT

Welcome to **NanoGPT**, a lightweight implementation of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models for experimenting with natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This project focuses on building and training compact GPT models with reduced computational overhead, making it ideal for educational purposes and small-scale NLP experiments.

## Project Overview

This repository includes the following components:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts to prepare and tokenize datasets for training.
2. **Model Architecture:** A minimal model based on the Transformer architecture.
3. **Training Pipeline:** Scripts to train the NanoGPT model on a variety of text datasets.
4. **Inference:** Tools to generate text samples from the trained model.

## Project Details

### 1. Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing module prepares raw text datasets for training by tokenizing and batching the data. It supports various popular datasets and allows custom dataset integration.

### 2. Model Architecture
NanoGPT implements a simplified version of the Transformer model, which is designed to generate text by predicting the next token in a sequence.

### 3. Training Pipeline
The training pipeline provides scripts for training the NanoGPT model with different configurations. You can specify hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and the number of Transformer layers.

### 4. Inference
This module includes tools for generating text using the trained NanoGPT model. You can provide a seed phrase, and the model will generate a continuation based on its learned patterns.
